# YouTube_Subscriber_Counter
Made for the WeMos D1 Mini

This is a rewrite of a project I found from a couple years ago.  Since YouTube changed their polocies on subscriber counts, namely rounding them instead of giving exact numbers, I had to do a lot of digging to find a way to make a YouTube subscriber counter that would show me EXACT numbers, like it used to.

This should be pretty easy to modify for your own needs.  Currently shows:
* Channel name
* Subscriber count
* Total views

I will eventually merge in the full graphics set from educ8s.tv, to make full use of the display as he originally intended, but with some additions.
